	<name>Matchbook</name>
	<description>You notice a small matchbook on the ground, it is red and black with light grazing on it from some use and look inside. Only a couple of matches left. Two have been used. You remember witnesses say they noticed a burning cigar near the body of the sheriff's wife.
-Take the matchbook, keeping it for backing the witness testimony.
-Discard the burnt matches and take the good ones.
