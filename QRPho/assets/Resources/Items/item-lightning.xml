	<description>Lightning strikes at your location. Feeling like it’s about to strike you down you think fast.
-You feel a rush of adrenaline as you hear the lightning crackle behind you and run for cover.
-You stand still and hope it misses you, seeing this as an opportunity to get close to something rarely experienced by many people.
